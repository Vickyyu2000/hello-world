In this SQL exercise, I created four tables: Classes, Ships, Battles, and Outcomes. Each table represents a relation in a scenario involving World War II capital ships.

For the Classes table, I created columns to store the class name, type (bb for battleship or bc for battlecruiser), country of origin, number of main guns, bore diameter of the main guns, and displacement (weight) in tons.

For the Ships table, I created columns to store the name of the ship, the name of its class, and the year in which the ship was launched.

For the Battles table, I created columns to store the name of the battle and the date it was fought.

For the Outcomes table, I created columns to store the name of the ship, the name of the battle, and the result of that ship in that battle (sunk, damaged, or ok).

Finally, I inserted the given data into each table using SQL insert statements. This allows for the data to be easily queried and analyzed using SQL.

All exercises can be check in the sql file.
