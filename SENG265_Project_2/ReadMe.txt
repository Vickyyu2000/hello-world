Overview:
This script takes a text file as input and produces left-aligned output lines for each index word. 
The output contains words to the left of the index word, but only if they do not go further left than column 10. 
Words to the right of the index word may appear but only if they do not go further right than column 60. 
The script also performs some error-checking to ensure that the input is in the correct format.

Functionality:
The script performs the following steps:

It reads the input file line by line.
It checks if the first line of the file is "1", in which case it exits and prints an error message.
It extracts exclude words and index lines from the input file into lists exclude_words and index_lines.
It removes any case-insensitive duplicates from index_words.
It removes any exclude words from index_words.
It sorts index_words in alphabetical order.
For each index word, it finds all lines in index_lines that contain the index word.
It splits each line into a list of words.
It creates a new list of words that contains the words to the left of the index word, the index word itself (in uppercase), and the words to the right of the index word.
It modifies the words to the left of the index word to ensure that they do not go further left than column 10.
It modifies the words to the right of the index word to ensure that they do not go further right than column 60.
It combines the modified words into a single output line.
It prints the final left-aligned output for each index word.
